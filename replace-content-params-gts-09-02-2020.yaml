    type: number
    label: Max Response Size (KB)
    description: |
        How deep in a response body should the Citrix ADC look to identify text strings to replace. 
        If the text string you want to replace, can occur anywhere in the response body, then you have
        to estimate what is the maximum size (in KiloBytes) of your responses. 
        Note that the bigger the response size you specify, the more impact on the Citrix ADC performance 
        and memory this has, as the Citrix ADC needs to buffer responses in order to search them.
    required: true
    default: 5
