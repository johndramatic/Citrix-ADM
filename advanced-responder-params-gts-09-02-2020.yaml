        Type of responder action. Available settings function as follows:
        * NOOP - Send the request to the protected server instead of responding to it.
        * RESET - Reset the client connection by closing it. The client program, such as a browser, will handle this and may inform the user. The client may then resend the request if desired.
        * DROP - Drop the request without sending a response to the user.
        * respondwith <target> - Respond to the request with the expression specified as the target.
        * redirect - Redirect the request to the URL specified as the target.

        In addition to NetScaler default-syntax expressions that refer to information in the request, a stringbuilder expression can contain text and HTML, and simple escape codes that define new lines and paragraphs. Enclose each stringbuilder expression element (either a NetScaler default-syntax expression or a string) in double quotation marks. Use the plus (+) character to join the elements.
        Examples:
        1) Respondwith expression that sends an HTTP 1.1 200 OK response:
        "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n"
        2) Redirect expression that redirects user to the specified web host and appends the request URL to the redirect.
        "http://backupsite2.com" + HTTP.REQ.URL
        3) Respondwith expression that sends an HTTP 1.1 404 Not Found response with the request URL included in the response:
        "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\n\r\n"+ "HTTP.REQ.URL.HTTP_URL_SAFE" + "does not exist on the web server."
